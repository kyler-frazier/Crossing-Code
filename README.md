Project title: Crossing Code

Author: Kyler Frazier

Created in May 2015.
Minor updates made over the years.

Java version 1.8.0
File that executes the program: Runner.java

Details:
A short and roughed out action-adventure game inspired from Pok�mon and CrossCode.
Uses JFrame. Images are displayed using Screen's paintComponent with a buffer.
Implements inheretance and creates items and characters as objects from classes.

Controls: 
  - Walk (WASD)
  - Run (Shift)
  - Talk/Interact (X)
  - Attack (Space)
  - Buy/Sell (E)

*** I recommend running the the game with more memory if the game becomes unstable. ***
*** --> java -Xms512m -Xmx1024m Runner.java                                         *** 

*** There is also an executable .jar file but it exceeds the file size for git.     ***

*** If the game is too challenging then there is a built in cheat-button, hitting "P", which will kill all enemies on the screen. ***

*** The screen size can be manually adjusted to your computer screen size by dragging the window corners or by hitting the fullscreen button ***
